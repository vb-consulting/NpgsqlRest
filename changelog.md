## Version [2.30.0](https://github.com/vb-consulting/NpgsqlRest/tree/2.30.0) (2025-08-09)

[Full Changelog](https://github.com/vb-consulting/NpgsqlRest/compare/2.29.0...2.30.0)

### Core Library

#### Breaking Changes

- **Removed Active Directory Federation Services Claim Types support**: Eliminated `UseActiveDirectoryFederationServicesClaimTypes` option and the entire `ClaimsDictionary` class that mapped claim names to AD FS URIs. Authentication now uses simple claim type names directly instead of attempting to resolve them to Microsoft AD FS claim type URIs.

- **Removed response parsing annotations**: Eliminated `parse` and `parse_response` comment annotations and the corresponding `ParseResponse` property from routine endpoints. This feature was used to parse single-column, single-row responses.

- **Simplified static file parsing**: Removed specific tag mappings (`UserIdTag`, `UserNameTag`, `UserRolesTag`, `CustomTagToClaimMappings`) from ParseContentOptions. Static file parsing now uses direct claim type names in `{claimType}` format instead of configurable tag names.

#### Bug Fixes

- **Authentication claim handling**: Fixed issues with claim type resolution by removing complex Active Directory Federation Services mapping and using direct claim types
- **Fix AuthorizePaths typo**: Corrected typo from `"AutorizePaths"` to `"AuthorizePaths"` in appsettings.json configuration file and updated corresponding references in App.cs and AppStaticFileMiddleware.cs
- **Fix Data Protection logging**: Fixed spacing issue in Data Protection logging message template for better log formatting

#### Improvements

- **Simplified authentication configuration**: 
  - Removed complex claim type mapping logic and `UseActiveDirectoryFederationServicesClaimTypes` option
  - Updated default claim type values to use simple names:
    - `DefaultUserIdClaimType`: changed from `"nameidentifier"` to `"id"`
    - `DefaultNameClaimType`: remains `"name"` (unchanged)  
    - `DefaultRoleClaimType`: changed from `"role"` to `"roles"`
  - Column names from login endpoint responses are now converted directly to claim types without any transformation or mapping

- **Streamlined static file content parsing**: Static files now use direct claim type substitution with `{claimType}` syntax, making the configuration much simpler and more straightforward

- **Enhanced info events broadcasting**: Improved Server-Sent Events (SSE) broadcasting functionality for info events:
  - Improved performance in `Broadcaster.cs` by removing unnecessary `.ToArray()`
  - Enhanced authorization scope checking in `NpgsqlRestNoticeEventSource.cs` to support user ID, name, and role claims for broadcast authorization
  - Broadcast authorization now checks against `DefaultUserIdClaimType`, `DefaultNameClaimType`, and not just only `DefaultRoleClaimType` claim types.
  - Authorization list now merges info hints and endpoint `InfoEventsRoles` settings.

### NpgsqlRest Client

#### Improvements

- **Enhanced connection logging**: Improved connection string logging in Builder.cs to handle cases where connection name is empty. Now properly logs "Using main connection string: {connection}" when no connection name is provided, instead of displaying an empty parameter
- **Expanded startup message**: Extended startup message to support additional placeholders:
  - `{3}` - Environment name (Development, Production, etc.)
  - `{4}` - Application name
  
  Updated Program.cs to pass these additional parameters, allowing for more detailed startup information like:
  ```
  "Started in {0}, listening on {1}, version {2}, environment {3}, application {4}"
  ```

## Version [2.29.0](https://github.com/vb-consulting/NpgsqlRest/tree/2.29.0) (2025-07-08)

[Full Changelog](https://github.com/vb-consulting/NpgsqlRest/compare/2.28.0...2.29.0)

### Core Library

#### Info Events Streaming Feature

This feature enables sending info events raised with [raise info statements](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/plpgsql-errors-and-messages.html) as SSE (Server-Side Events). When enabled, endpoints can stream real-time notifications to connected clients.

##### How It Works

When this feature is enabled, an endpoint will have an additional URL that can be used to connect as a new [`EventSource`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventSource) which will receive `RAISE INFO` notifications:

```js
const source = new EventSource(url);
source.onmessage = event => {
    console.log(event.data);
};
```

##### Generated Client Code

This functionality is encapsulated into the generated TsClient (TypeScript and JavaScript code) as a function parameter that accepts a string:

```js
const createRaiseNoticesEventSource = (id = "") => new EventSource(baseUrl + "/api/raise-notices/info?" + id);

async function raiseNotices(
    info = msg => msg
) {
    const executionId = window.crypto.randomUUID();
    const eventSource = createRaiseNoticesEventSource(executionId);
    eventSource.onmessage = event => {
        info(event.data);
    };
    try {
        const response = await fetch(raiseNoticesUrl(), {
            method: "GET",
            headers: {
                "X-NpgsqlRest-ID": executionId
            },
        });
        return response.status;
    }
    finally {
        setTimeout(() => eventSource.close(), 1000);
    }
}
```

By default, only sessions that initiated the original code will receive these notifications by using the function parameter. This behavior is also configurable.

##### Configuration Properties

There are three new properties on every endpoint instance to support this feature:

```cs
public string? InfoEventsStreamingPath { get; set; } = null;
public InfoEventsScope InfoEventsScope { get; set; } = InfoEventsScope.Self;
public HashSet<string>? InfoEventsRoles { get; set; } = null;
```

##### InfoEventsStreamingPath
Additional path appended as a subpath to the main endpoint path (null disables info events). If the endpoint path is `/path` and this value is set to `/info`, the streaming path will be `/path/info`.

##### InfoEventsScope
Scope that determines to whom events are streamed:

- **`Self`** (default): Only the original endpoint initiator session, regardless of the security context.
- **`Matching`**: Sessions with matching security context of the endpoint initiator. If the endpoint initiator requires authorization, all authorized sessions will receive these messages. If the endpoint initiator requires authorization for certain roles, all sessions requiring the same roles will receive these messages.
- **`Authorize`**: Only authorized sessions will receive these messages. If the `InfoEventsRoles` property contains a list of roles, only sessions with those roles will receive messages.
- **`All`**: All sessions regardless of the security context will receive these messages.

##### InfoEventsRoles
List (hash set) of authorized roles that will receive messages when `InfoEventsScope` is set to `Authorize`.

##### Comment Annotations

There are two new sets of comment annotations to support this feature:

```
info_path [ path | true | false ]
info_events_path [ path | true | false ]
info_streaming_path [ path | true | false ]
info_scope [ self | matching | authorize | all ] | [ authorize [ role1, role2, role3 [, ...] ] ]
info_events_scope [ self | matching | authorize | all ] | [ authorize [ role1, role2, role3 [, ...] ] ]
info_streaming_scope [ self | matching | authorize | all ] | [ authorize [ role1, role2, role3 [, ...] ] ]
```

Note: these annotations are also available as comment annotation parameters (`key = value` format):

```
info_path = [ path | true | false ]
info_events_path = [ path | true | false ]
info_streaming_path = [ path | true | false ]
info_scope = [ self | matching | authorize | all ] | [ authorize [ role1, role2, role3 [, ...] ] ]
info_events_scope = [ self | matching | authorize | all ] | [ authorize [ role1, role2, role3 [, ...] ] ]
info_streaming_scope = [ self | matching | authorize | all ] | [ authorize [ role1, role2, role3 [, ...] ] ]
```

###### 1. Set the Info Streaming Path

```
info_path [ path | true | false ]
info_events_path [ path | true | false ]
info_streaming_path [ path | true | false ]
```

**Note:** This can also be boolean. When set to `true`, the info streaming path will be `/info` which will be added to the main path.

###### 2. Set the Info Streaming Scope

```
info_scope [ self | matching | authorize | all ] | [ authorize [ role1, role2, role3 [, ...] ] ]
info_events_scope [ self | matching | authorize | all ] | [ authorize [ role1, role2, role3 [, ...] ] ]
info_streaming_scope [ self | matching | authorize | all ] | [ authorize [ role1, role2, role3 [, ...] ] ]
```

Set the scope for sessions receiving info messages: `self` (default), `matching`, `authorize`, or `all`. When using `authorize`, add an optional list of authorized roles.

##### Per-Message Scope Control

Scope comment annotation can be set on individual messages as the `hint` parameter:

```sql
raise info 'Self messages will be received only by sessions that initiated the original endpoint. This is the default if not set otherwise.' using hint = 'self';

raise info 'Only for sessions with matching security context as the session that initiated the original endpoint.' using hint = 'matching';

raise info 'Only for authorized sessions.' using hint = 'authorize';

raise info 'Only for authorized sessions with roles role1 and role2.' using hint = 'authorize role1, role2';

raise info 'Message for all connected sessions.' using hint = 'all';
```

##### New Options

There are two new options to support this feature:

```cs
    /// <summary>
    /// Name of the request ID header that will be used to track requests. This is used to correlate requests with streaming connection ids.
    /// </summary>
    public string ExecutionIdHeaderName { get; set; } = "X-NpgsqlRest-ID";

    /// <summary>
    /// Collection of custom server-sent events response headers that will be added to the response when connected to the endpoint that is configured to return server-sent events.
    /// </summary>
    public Dictionary<string, StringValues> CustomServerSentEventsResponseHeaders { get; set; } = [];
```

###### ExecutionIdHeaderName

Default scope option (self) means that only sessions that initiated the call can receive these messages. To achieve that, generated client code injects a custom header on each request that has info streaming enabled with a random number value. This is the name of this header.

###### CustomServerSentEventsResponseHeaders

List of custom SSE (Server-Sent Events) response headers that will be added automatically. Some browsers or servers may require this to be customized.

#### Auth Changes

There are some slight breaking changes to how authentication and authorization works, specifically in claims handling. From this version, the library doesn't use Active Directory Federation Services Claim Types by default anymore.

The reason for this change is because Microsoft has been updating these values in newer versions which could break the authorization mechanism on updates. And since it is not really necessary, simple values are used instead.

Four different default options in AuthenticationOptions have changed values:

##### 1. UseActiveDirectoryFederationServicesClaimTypes

From true to false obviously. When this is set to true, the value of either of these options DefaultUserIdClaimType, DefaultNameClaimType, DefaultRoleClaimType will try to match the field name (ignoring case) of this table: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.security.claims.claimtypes?view=net-9.0 and will have the corresponding value.

##### 2. DefaultUserIdClaimType

From `http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/05/identity/claims/nameidentifier` to `nameidentifier`.

##### 3. DefaultNameClaimType

From `http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/05/identity/claims/name` to `name`.

##### 4. DefaultRoleClaimType

From `http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/05/identity/claims/role` to `role`.

### NpgsqlRest Client

#### Fix Routine Source Initialization Bug

When configuration was missing empty `RoutineOptions` inside `NpgsqlRest` settings, routines wouldn't initialize. The quick fix was to add an empty `RoutineOptions` section like this:

```jsonc
{
  // ...
  "NpgsqlRest": {
    // ...
    "RoutineOptions": {
      "IncludeLanguages": null
    },
    // ...
  }
}
```

This is no longer required.

#### Kestrel Configuration Improvements

Previously, Kestrel configuration allowed configuring only `Endpoints` and `Certificates` sections. Now it allows configuring other Kestrel options like the `Limits` section and 6 other options. Full list:

```jsonc
{
  //...
  "Kestrel": {
      "Endpoints": {
          //...
      },
      "Certificates": {
          //...
      },

      // new settings
      "Limits": {
        "MaxConcurrentConnections": 100,
        "MaxConcurrentUpgradedConnections": 100,
        "MaxRequestBodySize": 30000000,
        "MaxRequestBufferSize": 1048576,
        "MaxRequestHeaderCount": 100,
        "MaxRequestHeadersTotalSize": 32768,
        "MaxRequestLineSize": 8192,
        "MaxResponseBufferSize": 65536,
        "KeepAliveTimeout": "00:02:00",
        "RequestHeadersTimeout": "00:00:30",
        "Http2": {
          "MaxStreamsPerConnection": 100,
          "HeaderTableSize": 4096,
          "MaxFrameSize": 16384,
          "MaxRequestHeaderFieldSize": 8192,
          "InitialConnectionWindowSize": 65535,
          "InitialStreamWindowSize": 65535,
          "MaxReadFrameSize": 16384,
          "KeepAlivePingDelay": "00:00:30",
          "KeepAlivePingTimeout": "00:01:00",
          "KeepAlivePingPolicy": "WithActiveRequests"
        },
        "Http3": {
          "MaxRequestHeaderFieldSize": 8192
        }
      },
      "DisableStringReuse": false,
      "AllowAlternateSchemes": false,
      "AllowSynchronousIO": false,
      "AllowResponseHeaderCompression": true,
      "AddServerHeader": true,
      "AllowHostHeaderOverride": false
  },
  //...
}
```

These are just the default values. 

Initial configuration is commented out so that the client uses the default versions of the framework which can change in newer versions. This opens the opportunity for Web Server optimizations like this, for example:

```jsonc
{
  "Kestrel": {
    "AddServerHeader": false, // remove unnecessary header
    "Limits": {
      // increase max limits for high workload
      "MaxConcurrentConnections": 10000,
      "MaxConcurrentUpgradedConnections": 10000
    }
  }
}
```

#### ThreadPool Configuration

You can also set thread pool parameters (min and max number of worker threads and completion port threads).

```jsonc
{
  "ThreadPool": {
    "MinWorkerThreads": null,
    "MinCompletionPortThreads": null,
    "MaxWorkerThreads": null,
    "MaxCompletionPortThreads": null
  }
}
```

If you are expecting higher workload, you can set the initial number of minimal threads to a higher number and not wait for them to scale up automatically (which affects latency):


```jsonc
{
  "ThreadPool": {
    "MinWorkerThreads": 1000,
    "MinCompletionPortThreads": 1000
  }
}
```

### TsClient

TsClient plugin code generator for TypeScript and JavaScript clients had a major revamp to support new features.

#### TsClient New Settings

There are 3 new settings supported as options and as configuration settings:

##### ExportEventSources

Set to true to export event sources create functions for streaming events. Default is true.

##### CustomImports

List of custom imports to add to the generated code. It adds a line to the file. Use full expression like `import { MyType } from './my-type';`. Default is an empty list.

##### CustomHeaders

Dictionary of custom headers to add to each request in generated code. Header key is automatically quoted if it doesn't contain quotes. Default is an empty dictionary.

#### TsClient Comment Annotation Parameters

TsClient now supports tweaking behavior with comment annotation parameters:

```
tsclient = [ false | off | disabled | disable | 0 ]
tsclient_events = [ [ false | off | disabled | disable | 0 ] | [ true | on | enabled | enable | 1 ] ]
tsclient_parse_url = [ [ false | off | disabled | disable | 0 ] | [ true | on | enabled | enable | 1 ] ]
tsclient_parse_request = [ [ false | off | disabled | disable | 0 ] | [ true | on | enabled | enable | 1 ] ]
tsclient_status_code = [ [ false | off | disabled | disable | 0 ] | [ true | on | enabled | enable | 1 ] ]
```

- `tsclient = [ false | off | disabled | disable | 0 ]` - disable tsclient code generation for the endpoint.
- `tsclient_events = [ [ false | off | disabled | disable | 0 ] | [ true | on | enabled | enable | 1 ] ]` - enable or disable info event parameter for endpoints with info events enabled.
- `tsclient_parse_url = [ [ false | off | disabled | disable | 0 ] | [ true | on | enabled | enable | 1 ] ]` - enable or disable info event parameter URL parsing.
- `tsclient_parse_request = [ [ false | off | disabled | disable | 0 ] | [ true | on | enabled | enable | 1 ] ]` - enable or disable info event parameter request parsing.
- `tsclient_status_code = [ [ false | off | disabled | disable | 0 ] | [ true | on | enabled | enable | 1 ] ]` - enable or disable status code in the return value.
